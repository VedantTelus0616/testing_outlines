The generator should also include an option to generate code for server-side rendering.\",\n",
      "\t\"Solution\": \"Unfortunately, a full implementation of such a complex generator is beyond the scope of this response. However, here's a high-level outline of the solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Design Specification Extraction:**\n",
      "   - Use Figma's API to fetch the design specs, including layout, colors, typography, components, and their interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Code Generation Architecture:**\n",
      "   - Develop a modular system that can generate code for React and Angular separately.\n",
      "   - Implement separate modules for state management (Redux for React, NgRx for Angular).\n",
      "   - Create a responsive layout generator, using CSS Grid or Flexbox.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Component Generation:**\n",
      "   - Parse Figma components into reusable UI components, considering different states and variations.\n",
      "   - Generate custom hooks for optimized performance, like `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` in React, and `ngOnChanges`, `ngDoCheck` in Angular.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**\n",
      "   - For React, integrate Next.js or Gatsby to generate server-side rendered code.\n",
      "   - For Angular, use Angular Universal or a custom SSR setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Testing and Refinement:**\n",
      "   - Implement unit tests for generated components to ensure functionality.\n",
      "   - Integrate with a testing library (e.g., Jest for React, Jasmine for Angular).\n",
      "   - Gather feedback and improve the code generator's accuracy and efficiency.\n",
